Blog on difference between Window and Document Object:

1.	Window is the execution context and global object for that context's JavaScript.
2.	Document contains the DOM, initialized by parsing HTML.
3.	The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document whereas document object is property of window object that points to
     the DOM document loaded in that window. You can access a document object either using window.
4.	Other Windows execution context enclosing and reference are window.parent  and window.top and always window.window refers to window.
5.	Window properties are listed below
     •	setTimeout() and setInterval() binding events handlers to a timer.
     •	Location giving the current URL
     •	Nagivator describing the browser software
     •	History with methods back() and forward() giving the tab’s mutable history
6.	Each window object has a document object to be rendered.
7.	If we assign document object with a unique Id eg ., in the HTML snippet it get confused because HTML elements are added with global object.
      <body>
      <p id = “car”> This is the first paragraph. </p>
      </body>
The paragraph element can be referenced by any of the following:
    •	Window.car or window[“car”]
    •	Document.getElementById(“car”)
    •	Document.querySelector(“#car”)
8.	The window is the first object loaded in the browser and global JavaScript objects, functions and variables automatically.
9.	Window object has majority of the properties like length, innerWidth, innerHeight, name.
10.	HTML documents, content type served with the “text/HTML”, also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and SVG 
    documents implement the interface as XMLDocument.
11.	Since the window object is the Global object, ergo, it is the end of all scope chains, you don’t have to explicitly specify it when accessing its properties
